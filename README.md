## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the SDK, you need:

1.	An Agent ID: A unique identifier for each AI Agent.
2.	An API Key: A secure key for authenticating requests.

Please visit [our website](`https://wayfound.ai`) to get started.

### Initialize the SDK

Hereâ€™s how you can initialize the Wayfound SDK in your JavaScript project:

```javascript
import { Recording } from 'wayfound';

const recording = new Recording({
  wayfoundApiKey: '<API_KEY>',
  agentId: '<AGENT_ID>',
});
```

Replace <API_KEY> and <AGENT_ID> with your actual API key and Agent ID, for production scenarios keep the <API_KEY> secure.

### Usage

#### Record Messages

You can record messages and send them to Wayfound for processing:

```javascript
const messages = [
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hello, how can I help you?' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'I need assistance with my account.' },
];

recording.recordMessages(messages);
```

#### Manage Agent Data

Use the SDK to manage agent transcripts and access analytics for monitoring and reporting.
